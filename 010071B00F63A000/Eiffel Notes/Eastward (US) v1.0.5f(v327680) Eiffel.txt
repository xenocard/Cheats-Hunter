Note:
Health / Instant Kill do not works in mini game
but money works

Known issue
Inf. HP should be off in some stage (for opening a kind of door)
Inf Health may cause the snake and bugs invincible, and eggs become unbreakable that block the path, you should restart the game or die once, without enable inf. health


the master code:
it may become a cheat code template for all games developed by MOAI engine / GameMaker / Yoyo Games etc.

All variables in this game are double float, or a masked U64 integer (e.g. 99 becomes FFF9000000000063 )

And the setter / getter / arithmetic operator etc all perform in the same common functions, it is difficult to find out where access these common function


I can only hack that by compare the variable key names

Luckily there is a masked pointer follows the variables, I can distinguish the keyname at there.

I give an example, Money, 9999 can be search with 0x40C3878000000000
then there should be a masked pointer follows, e.g. 0xFFFD801A8EDA2940
(FFFD80 is a signal show that it is a pointer, 1A8EDA2940 is stand for a pointer address)



    is it Possible to Create invincible cheat be made
    ill add a button trigger for HP cheat to not die from boss hits and release Trigger to continue fight when he doesn't attack

    Thank you for the Info
    Take your Time, i am more interested to see how you develop the cheats for it

button can set easily, but it will be difficult to manipulate
e.g.
[Infinite Health (hold ZR)]
040E0000 0095AFFC 00000000
80000200
040E0000 0095AFFC 00000001
20000000

if you reverse the above code, i.e. default invincible, the same error may occur. However, everything need to test (may be a few days later, I miss too many game update)
[Infinite Health (hold ZR to off)]
040E0000 0095AFFC 00000001
80000200
040E0000 0095AFFC 00000000
20000000

notes by test
Something in the new codes stops you from receiving new items like pixball cards and even the weapons looks like you pick it up but item don't increase or show at all like you recieve it. old codes work though "these"
