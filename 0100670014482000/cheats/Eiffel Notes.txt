Usage for Teleport
1) The teleport target location according to that on the map, and the number beside mini-map is the distance between player and the TP target.
2) By the game rule, the default target location is the current quest location. And you can change the target by press (+ or -), and mark a custom target
3) Hold zL+zR+RightStick for at least 3 seconds. check is the final result position, then you can do some adjustment by Left-Stick (4 directions for N,E,S,W and L-stick IN for UP z-index)
the displacement (adjustment by the L-Stick ) is +4/-4, you may adjust these float numbers (40800000/C0800000) for customize the displacement

Note for the hack:

1) not yet find the Durability of Armor, [Armor never damage] only affects the addition of equipment to the health value, and does not deduct

2) Invincible only prevent the damage by enemies (till not find the fall damage)

3) Teleport and FlyUp are buggy that cannot be fixed, however it help a lot on fast follow to the game.
