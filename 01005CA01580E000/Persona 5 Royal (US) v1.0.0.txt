Kaito B Notes:

[No Random Encounters]
If you are attacked, you will not enter the battle, which means that even if you are discovered and attacked by the enemy, there will be no battle. 

[Always Attack First] + [Minimum increase in Alertness]
The initiative is on Player side. Only the phantom thieves will enter the battle interface when they attack the enemy. Please use it with the [Alertness] Cheat

This is mainly for elite monsters, and ordinary monsters can use [Stealth Mode] [First attack] may not be effective for consecutive battles under high Alert level. The enemy's action priority is high

2. The persona born from the fusion, the basic data is easy to be rewarded, so sometimes it will have a high ability from the beginning.
