Notes;

1.) Note about the 60 FPS Cheat.
No it will not magically put your FPS to 60 when you use it. Try Overclocking your Switch to Max and The FPS is still not Stable at 60 (Except if you're in a light Area like your House). The Switch is Weak to Achieve Constant 60 FPS for this Game.

2.) [Game Speed Toggle] Button Combos;


Normal Speed (x1) = L + Dpad UP
Slightly Faster Speed (x1.5) = L + Dpad LEFT
Faster Speed (x2) = L + Dpad RIGHT

Note : [Game Speed Toggle] will not work Properly if [(Hold L3) Game Speed x2] is active.

3.) [(ZL+ZR) Prayer Pot Lvl. 20] Press the button combo then Offer a Charm at the Prayer Pot.

4.) 1st P.P.B. is Prayer Pot Buff (Pray).
Activate only one Buff.

5.) 2nd P.P.B. is Prayer Pot Buff (Offer Charm).
Activate only one Buff.

6.) Can activate both 1st and 2nd P.P.B.
Just one each. But the 2nd P.P.B. is the only shown in the Pause Menu.

7.) [Monstie's Size Toggle ZR+DPad/R STICK];
